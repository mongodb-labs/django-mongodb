# Django MongoDB Backend

This backend is currently in development and is not advised for production workflows. Backwards incompatible
changes may be made without notice. We welcome your feedback as we continue to
explore and build. The best way to share this is via our [MongoDB Community Forum](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/tag/python).

## Install

Use the version of `django-mongodb-backend` that corresponds to your version of
Django. For example, to get the latest compatible release for Django 5.1.x:
```bash
$ pip install --pre django-mongodb-backend==5.1.*
```
(Until the package is out of beta, you must use pip's `--pre` option.)


## Quickstart

### Start project

From your shell, run the following command to create a new Django project
called `example` using our custom template. Make sure the zipfile referenced
at the end of the template link corresponds to your
version of Django. The snippet below specifies `5.1.x.zip` at the end of
the template url to get the template for any Django version matching 5.1:

```bash
$ django-admin startproject example --template https://github.com/mongodb-labs/django-mongodb-project/archive/refs/heads/5.1.x.zip
```


### Connect to the database

Navigate to your `example/settings.py` file and find the variable named
`DATABASES` Replace the `DATABASES` variable with this:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": django_mongodb_backend.parse_uri("<CONNECTION_STRING_URI>"),
}
```

The MongoDB `<CONNECTION_STRING_URI>` must also specify a database for the
`parse_uri` function to work.
If not already included, make sure you provide a value for `<DATABASE_NAME>`
in your URI as shown in the example below:
```bash
mongodb+srv://myDatabaseUser:D1fficultP%40ssw0rd@cluster0.example.mongodb.net/<DATABASE_NAME>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```


### Run the server
To verify that you installed Django MongoDB Backend and correctly configured your project, run the following command from your project root:
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```
Then, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/. This page displays a "Congratulations!" message and an image of a rocket.


## Capabilities of Django MongoDB Backend

- **Model MongoDB Documents Through Django’s ORM**

  - Store Django model instances as MongoDB documents.
  - Maps Django's built-in fields to MongoDB data types.
  - Provides custom fields for arrays (`ArrayField`) and embedded documents (`EmbeddedModelField`).
  - Supports core migration functionalities.
- **Index Management**
  - Create single, compound, partial, and unique indexes using Django Indexes.
- **Querying Data**
  - Supports most of the Django QuerySet API.
  - Supports relational field usage and executes `JOIN` operations with MQL.
  - A custom `QuerySet.raw_aggregate` method exposes MongoDB-specific operations like Vector Search, Atlas Search, and GeoSpatial querying to yield Django QuerySet results.
- **Administrator Dashboard & Authentication**
  - Manage your data in Django’s admin site.
  - Fully integrated with Django's authentication framework.
  - Supports native user management features like creating users and session management.
